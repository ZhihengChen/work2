                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>The concept behind the multisensory virtual interactive installation, "Black and White Television," is to create an immersive experience for the audience by combining visual, auditory, and tactile elements. The installation utilizes a virtual black and white TV and speakers, controlled by music, mouse position, and slider data. The project aims to stimulate the audience's senses and provide an engaging and interactive encounter.</p>
                <p>Originally, the plan was to generate virtual objects and integrate them into physical devices, utilizing real speakers and buttons. However, due to unforeseen challenges, the final presentation of the physical setup did not meet the my expectations. As a result, virtual versions of the black and white TV and speakers were developed, and a three.js scene was constructed to enhance control over lighting, space, position, materials, and size. </p>
                <p>The project implementation involved the use of fragment and vertex shaders to create animations for the virtual objects. The three.js library built the 3D scene, imported the TV and speakers models, and incorporated an audio file. Data from the audio, mouse position, and GUI elements were then passed to the fragment shader to enable audience interaction with the virtual objects on the screen. </p>

                <p>我将结合使用图像处理技术，将网络摄像头图像转换为灰度图像，对灰度图像进行阈值化处理以获得二值图像，然后使用颜色检测技术提取所需的颜色。

                    提取颜色后，我将使用像素化和色散聚类效果，在用户身上营造出火焰的外观。这可以通过对提取的颜色应用像素化效果，然后使用色散聚类将像素分散到用户身体周围来实现。
                    
                    最后，我使用运动检测算法来跟踪用户的运动，并相应地调整火焰的强度。这可以通过分析网络摄像头画面中用户身体的移动来实现，然后根据移动情况调整火焰的强度。</p>

                <p>Throughout the project, I encountered challenges that prompted a shift in my original approach. While the final rendering and modelling of the 3D scene were satisfying, the animation of the virtual objects and the interactive aspects of the installation require further improvement. I acknowledge the need to explore additional algorithms to enhance the generation of virtual objects and plan to dedicate more time to studying three.js and advancing my skills in 3D object programming.</p>
